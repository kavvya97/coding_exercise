### FETCH PAYER BALANCE

### Background

Our users have points in their accounts. Users only see a single balance in their accounts. But for reporting purposes, we actually track their points per payer. In our system, each transaction record contains: payer (string), points (integer), timestamp (date). 
For earning points, it is easy to assign a payer. We know which actions earned the points. And thus, which partner should be paying for the points. 
When a user spends points, they don't know or care which payer the points come from. But, our accounting team does care how the points are spent. There are two rules for determining what points to "spend" first: 
- We want the oldest points to be spent first (oldest based on transaction timestamp, not the order theyâ€™re received) 
- We want no payer's points to go negative. 

The code processes the input argument and returns payer's balances

> Example 

1.  Pass in an argument which is the amount of points to spend while running the program

```
python3 mycode.py 5000
```
1. code will ingest a CSV file with an example sequence:
``` 
"payer","points","timestamp"
"DANNON",1000,"2020-11-02T14:00:00Z"
"UNILEVER",200,"2020-10-31T11:00:00Z"
"DANNON",-200,"2020-10-31T15:00:00Z"
"MILLER COORS",10000,"2020-11-01T14:00:00Z"
"DANNON",300,"2020-10-31T10:00:00Z"
```


1. Output format
```
{ 
"DANNON": 1000, 
"UNILEVER": 0, 
"MILLER COORS": 5300 
} 
```
